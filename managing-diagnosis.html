            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Talk openly with your doctor:</strong> Ask every question on your mind — no question is too small when it comes to your health. Understanding what’s happening in your body empowers you to make informed decisions.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Get a second opinion:</strong> Especially if your diagnosis was not made by a cancer specialist, getting confirmation from another physician can help ensure accuracy and expand your treatment options.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Educate yourself about your diagnosis:</strong> Visit the “Know Thyself” section for accessible summaries of common cancers by organ system. Understanding your specific cancer can make conversations with your care team more meaningful.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Make a treatment plan with your specialist:</strong> You know your body; your doctor knows your cancer. Collaborate to create an effective plan that feels right for you.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Review your finances carefully:</strong> Confirm what your insurance will cover and speak with a hospital financial counselor for help. If you’re uninsured or underinsured, you may qualify for government or nonprofit aid.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Prioritize your physical and mental health:</strong> Eat well, get rest, and find time for joy and support. Staying strong — emotionally and physically — will help you through treatment.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Use available support services:</strong> Florida offers many free or reduced-cost mental health resources for cancer patients. Visit the “Managing the Stress of a Cancer Diagnosis” section to explore support options.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Plan for your long-term health:</strong> After treatment, follow your care team’s advice for follow-ups and monitoring. Being proactive about your health is essential to recovery and beyond.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Build a support system:</strong> Whether it’s a family member, close friend, or trusted neighbor, make sure someone is there to advocate for you and support your care journey.

          This is an incredibly stressful and frustrating time. Cancer sucks; it's scary, confusing, and overwhelming. However, over the course of the 21st century, the effectiveness of cancer treatment has grown exponentially.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another fortunate (or perhaps unfortunate) reality about cancer is that you are most certainly not the only individual to face the specific type of cancer that you have. It is absolutely true that your body is unique, and meaning that your cancer is unique to you. However, cancer itself tends to follow certain patterns. As this website has mentioned time and time again, you know yourself best. When paired with your unique knowledge of yourself, and the incredible knowledge of your team, cancer CAN be beaten. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Though sometimes, knowing that just isn’t enough. Talking with others who are going through or have gone through cancer treatment can be incredibly helpful in getting guidance throughout the treatment process, releasing some pent up stress, and feeling less alone in general. Support is always available, and there are many local, virtual, and other free support groups available if this is something you’re interested in. Below you can find the links to many different websites providing free access to support groups:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>American Cancer Society:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>24/7 Free Cancer Support line: <a href="tel:1-800-227-2345">1-800-227-2345</a></li>
              <li>
                Find free support groups by zip code:
                <a href="https://www.cancer.org/support-programs-and-services/resource-search.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                  cancer.org/resource-search
                </a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cancer Hope Network:</strong>
            Free, non-profit organization that provides one-on-one support.
            <a href="https://cancerhopenetwork.org/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAz6q-BhCfARIsAOezPxmJs8WrxOYT8pZRgEr9uK4O3EbFdjAr_bGVp4xABySwW8LaAHPBTYEaAqriEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
              cancerhopenetwork.org
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mayo Clinic:</strong>
            Has support groups for specific types of cancers and treatments. Support groups meet via Zoom.
            <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida/support-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
              mayoclinic.org/support-groups
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Support groups alone may not be enough either. While insurance should cover counseling services, this is not always the case. Insurances often limit the number of sessions covered, and have contracts with specific counselors / agencies. If this is the case, or if you are uninsured, many hospitals have free, one-on-one counseling services that your oncologist should be able to direct you to. Additionally, you can contact your hospital’s social worker / patient navigator for more information.

          Finally, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/fl/tampa?category=in-person&cost=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psychology Today</a> offers a ‘sliding scale’ based on income, and allows for you to filter therapists based on specialty, income, biological sex, and many other filters that you may be interested in.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In order to filter therapists, click the blue “All Filters” button on the top right of the screen. Financial filters are located at the bottom of the filter page, with the ‘sliding scale’ option being located at the bottom right.</li>
