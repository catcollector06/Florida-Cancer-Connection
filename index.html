        <ul>
          <li>Provide you and your loved ones with <strong>free cancer screenings</strong> and other cancer-related resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Make cancer education accessible and digestible</strong> with high quality explanations and illustrations, so anyone can understand how cancer works. Because knowing the signs early can save lives.</li>

        <h2>Why learn about cancer?</h2>
        <p>The risk of cancer associated mortality worsens the later it is caught. Learning about cancer will help you identify cancer’s early symptoms so that you can recognize when something isn’t right, and take action sooner.</p>
        <p>Whether you're here for yourself, a loved one, or just to learn, we hope this site helps you find resources and navigate the world of cancer.</p>
