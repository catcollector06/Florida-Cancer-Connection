        <h2>Why learn about cancer?</h2>
        <p>The risk of cancer associated mortality worsens the later it is caught. Learning about cancer will help you identify cancer’s early symptoms so that you can recognize when something isn’t right, and take action sooner.</p>
        <p>Whether you're here for yourself, a loved one, or just to learn, we hope this site helps you find resources and navigate the world of cancer.</p>
